# Grammar Development Final Project: English Relative Clauses

_Group members: Ema Nesic, Romaisaa Ahmed, Yeganeh Salehi_

## Introduction

With the assignment prompt of accounting for a linguistic phenomenon in xle structure, our group looked to capture English relative clauses - seeing that all three members have different native languages, we reasoned English grammatical constructions would serve well as a common denominator. Additionally, we chose to look at relative clauses, a cross-linguistic phenomenon that, in addition to not having been previously discussed in the present course, is syntactically straightforward and may be implemented in our existing grammar.


### Relative Clauses
Relative clauses refer to some clause that modifies a preceding entity, indicated in English by relative pronouns (i.e., who, when, that) - this is illustrated in the sentence "I see the forest **where**
I used to hike", where the pronoun **where** modifies _the forest_.

## Part III - Remaining Challenges and Future Refinement

One significant issue is accurately disambiguating relative pronouns that serve multiple syntactic roles, such as "who" and "which," which can function as both subjects and objects. Additionally, ensuring correct agreement between the relative pronoun and its antecedent, particularly in complex sentences with nested clauses, remains difficult. Another challenge lies in effectively capturing the distinctions between defining and non-defining relative clauses, which are crucial for conveying precise meanings in translation and syntactic analysis. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing refinement of rule-based algorithms and context-sensitive parsing techniques.
